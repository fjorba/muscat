The **Digital objects** database collects all of the images (typically watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings) and MEI incipits that are attached to records in Muscat. Digital objects can be attached to sources, people, and institutions. A digital object can be attached to multiple records.

New digital objects can only be added from the editing mode of a source, person, or institution. From the record, click on on **Attach a new image** and follow the upload instructions.

You can edit or delete digital objects that you have uploaded.

From any digital object, you will find links to attach it to a source, person, or institution.
